<p><strong>People Shape, and are Shaped by, Ideas</strong></p><p><strong>By Gary Jaron</strong></p><p>As a result of my mystic vision as a young child this phrase came to mind, “People shape, and are shaped by, ideas”. It came to sum up the meaning of that vision.</p><p>My vision, my quest for mapping reality as understood by humans, came to coalesce around this single phrase. The phrase describes a dynamic, never-ending process, a dialectical relationship between an individual and her specific and individual symbolic environment. This phrase is another important example of how we participate in the reality we come to experience. That phrase points to the dialectic nature of the third shaping factor I discussed in the prior chapter, Culture.</p><p>Our environment shapes every one of us, and being human, the most significant aspect of that environment is the rich symbolic atmosphere we live in. That symbolic environment is humanly constructed; it is the culture we live in. Words are the most prominent portion of that environment.—we are as fish swimming and living in a sea of words.</p><p>From the moment of our birth, we are exposed to this territory of words. Words sustain and maintain every human culture and the immediate human environment that we live in. The ideas that make up a culture’s values, beliefs, and metaphors are what shapes us and sustains us.</p><p>It is important to notice that I use the word shape. We are not pre-determined or destined, or limited by the ideas that we were exposed to growing up in our specific cultures. This is not a map of cultural determinism. The ideas of our culture shape us, and by this, I mean to convey that they inspire us and they mold us. We respond to them positively or negatively, we accept them or reject them, and acceptance and rejection are two ends of the continuum describing an infinite possibility of our responses to that cultural environment.</p><p>Our enculturation process has shaped the ideas, values, and beliefs we hold. It also shapes our personal experience. Knowing what our enculturation process is, gives us a valuable tool to analyze what we see, experience, and believe. Studying this enculturation process enables us to realize that this shaping process has created within us previously unconscious biases that affect what we see. Understanding this process does not mean that our choices are limited. I am not saying that we will inevitably believe what we were taught. We can, and do, consciously, and unconsciously, shape our own ideas.</p><p>Understanding this process does not enable us to predict our future actions completely. The future is potentially open ended and filled with options and possibilities. We can always choose to act in a manner that seems to be stupid or foolish or ignores our best interests. These pejorative terms may not be valid; they may only be biased from our conscious perspective. We can choose to listen to our intuition, our unconscious. Our unconscious and our intuition is our reservoir of beliefs, needs, desires, somatic feelings, and even a possible connection to the divine. Many times when we make a seemingly irrational or seemingly un-rational choice, what we have done is make a rational choice based upon one or many of our unconscious beliefs, needs, and desires.</p><p>To be a human is to understand the Territory in a human way, through the lens of the culture that we have been exposed to. This process of being shaped is how we come to wear our specific set of tinted lenses at every given moment of our lives.</p><p>All humans have been shaped by ideas. All ideas came from humans who were shaped by ideas. The set of ideas that make up the tint and prescription of our glasses is the cognitive box we live in. The set of ideas that makes up the tint of our glasses are the cognitive tools we use to explore and understand the Territory of the external and our internal world.</p><p>In the end, we never understand experience directly and untainted by our past. By this statement, I mean that we never come to understand an experience that doesn’t go through the unconscious and subconscious brain/mind, the second and third levels of the brain/mind. In this process, the experience gets shaped by those filters. All of our understanding of experience is affected by, and thus shaped by, the ideas we have stored in our mind. Never forget that at birth we begin our exposure to a specific human language and thus the culture that the language sustains. Every language sustains a different human culture. We are shaped by ideas and we shape these ideas as we live out our lives. My phrase describes the dynamic relationship of ideas and sensory data coming into our mind/body.</p><p>Although we interact through our senses directly with the world around us, when it comes to conscious interaction with the world, in a very real way we do not understand the experience of our world directly, but do so through our tinted glasses. Those ideas we have come to incorporate into our accepted system of beliefs become part of our new lenses. Every human, past, present and future, all of us were, are, and will be, shaped by ideas. Using those past acquisitions of ideas, we all shape our own current and future ideas. We literally may only see and hear what we believe we should, and want to, see and hear.</p><p>To truly understand an idea, I believe we must reflect on, and consider, the human who created that idea. We must investigate the tint of the lenses that this specific individual human creator wears. We need to acknowledge the box that every individual thinker inhabits.</p><p>Suggest Readings:</p><p><em>The Second Sex</em> by Simone de Beauvoir</p><p><em>The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man’s Changing Vision of the Universe</em> by Arthur Koestler</p><p><em>Science and the Modern World</em> by Alfred North Whitehead</p><p><em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> by Thomas S.
