<p><strong>People Shape, and are Shaped by, Ideas</strong></p><p><strong>By Gary Jaron</strong></p><p>As a result of my mystic vision as a young child this phrase came to mind, “People shape, and are shaped by, ideas”. It came to sum up the meaning of that vision.</p><p>My vision, my quest for mapping reality as understood by humans, came to coalesce around this single phrase. The phrase describes a dynamic, never-ending process, a dialectical relationship between an individual and her specific and individual symbolic environment. This phrase is another important example of how we participate in the reality we come to experience. That phrase points to the dialectic nature of the third shaping factor I discussed in the prior chapter, Culture.</p><p>Our environment shapes every one of us, and being human, the most significant aspect of that environment is the rich symbolic atmosphere we live in. That symbolic environment is humanly constructed; it is the culture we live in. Words are the most prominent portion of that environment.—we are as fish swimming and living in a sea of words.</p><p>From the moment of our birth, we are exposed to this territory of words. Words sustain and maintain every human culture and the immediate human environment that we live in. The ideas that make up a culture’s values, beliefs, and metaphors are what shapes us and sustains us.</p><p>It is important to notice that I use the word shape. We are not pre-determined or destined, or limited by the ideas that we were exposed to growing up in our specific cultures. This is not a map of cultural determinism. The ideas of our culture shape us, and by this, I mean to convey that they inspire us and they mold us. We respond to them positively or negatively, we accept them or reject them, and acceptance and rejection are two ends of the continuum describing an infinite possibility of our responses to that cultural environment.</p><p>Our enculturation process has shaped the ideas, values, and beliefs we hold. It also shapes our personal experience. Knowing what our enculturation process is, gives us a valuable tool to analyze what we see, experience, and believe. Studying this enculturation process enables us to realize that this shaping process has created within us previously unconscious biases that affect what we see. Understanding this process does not mean that our choices are limited. I am not saying that we will inevitably believe what we were taught. We can, and do, consciously, and unconsciously, shape our own ideas.</p><p>Understanding this process does not enable us to predict our future actions completely. The future is potentially open ended and filled with options and possibilities. We can always choose to act in a manner that seems to be stupid or foolish or ignores our best interests. These pejorative terms may not be valid; they may only be biased from our conscious perspective. We can choose to listen to our intuition, our unconscious. Our unconscious and our intuition is our reservoir of beliefs, needs, desires, somatic feelings, and even a possible connection to the divine. Many times when we make a seemingly irrational or seemingly un-rational choice, what we have done is make a rational choice based upon one or many of our unconscious beliefs, needs, and desires.</p><p>So, what is an idea? John Locke defines idea as ‘<em>whatever is the object of understanding when a man thinks.</em>’<a href="ab4fc871-2d77-405f-b86d-206e5b6bbfaa#_ftn1">[1]</a> I would expand upon Locke’s definition and say that an idea is the outcome, the results of the processing of incoming data within a brain/mind. The raw material out of which an idea is made is information coming through the body’s sensory systems. Data that has been stored in memory can be and is utilized in this act of thinking, but originally anything that was in memory came to be there by first going through the sensory system. Thinking is the process of trying to understand, comprehend, and utilize all sensory data. The results of these processes are ideas. Ideas can become embodied as a symbol, a single word, or a single sentence. I believe that ideas are further utilized by the brain/mind as the equivalent of cognitive tools, and when they are utilized in this tool capacity, the idea becomes a metaphor.</p><p><em>A word changes the situation dramatically. A word (aside from proper names) is a symbol that denotes a concept; it is a concrete, perceptually graspable symbol. …Only concretes exist. If a concept is to exist, therefore, it must exist in some way as a concrete. That is the function of language ‘Language,’ writes Ayn Rand, ‘is a code of visual-auditory symbols that serves the …function of converting concepts into the mental equivalent of concretes.<strong><a href="ab4fc871-2d77-405f-b86d-206e5b6bbfaa#_ftn2">[2]</a></strong></em></p><p>Idea is another word for concept, and they exist when they find embodiment in words. Ideas begin in the internal realm of an individual mind. I believe that they first begin non-verbally, as an abstraction a feeling that hints at some recognition of relationships between other things. Ideas become fully realize when they move from the non-verbal abstraction into the specifics of the verbal. Ideas take on concreteness and specificity when they become expressed in words.</p><p>Ideas do not spring Athena-like out of your head without rhyme or reason. Rather, they grow organically out of our imaginative metaphoric and embodied mind. Ideas are the culmination of our conscious and unconscious thought and brain processes and they have discoverable and traceable origins. Ideas can be metaphorically compared to plants, they have roots that can be traced back, they start as small seedlings that with care and the right environment will grow and develop, and they can be grafted by taking cuttings from one plant and attaching them to a new plant, and so on.</p><p>This process of being shaped is ongoing, for we are continually living in human cultures. On the one hand, the culture we live in sustains the status quo, the current set of ideas we have accepted or rejected. Nevertheless, since living is a dynamic and ongoing event, that culture can stimulate us with new ideas that we respond to. We are always interacting with and responding to our environment. This process is conscious or unconscious. Our environment is both humanly constructed and natural.</p><p>When we are born, it is as if we are given tinted glasses through which we understand our world, the Territory. The tint of those glasses is specific to each specific culture and that specificity has a temporal element. We live not in an abstract cultural environment, but in a specific culture at a specific place and point in time. We understand the Territory through the tint of our culture’s set of ideas. The ideas of a culture at the second level of the brain/mind, the unconscious mind, act as filters to the incoming sense data. Thus, like all filters, they allow in certain data and prevent other data from ever getting in, just as tinted glass admits only certain colors of the spectrum.</p><p>The idea that we live with tinted glasses came to me back when I had that revelation as a child. It was a shock of delight to find the idea reflected in the words of Robert Pirsig:</p><p><em>The culture in which we live hands us a set of intellectual glasses to interpret experience with, and the concept of the primacy of subjects and objects is built right into those glasses. If someone see things through a somewhat different set of glasses or, God help him, takes his glasses off, the natural tendency of those who still have their glasses on is to regard his statements as somewhat weird, if not actually crazy.<strong><a href="ab4fc871-2d77-405f-b86d-206e5b6bbfaa#_ftn3">[3]</a></strong></em></p><p>Throughout our life, the lenses of those tinted glasses change as we come to accept new ideas. As we get old enough to think for ourselves, we too can adjust the lenses by how we think about the ideas we have already been exposed to and how we react to new ideas. Nevertheless, we never can understand the world other than through our tinted glasses.</p><p>We can adjust the tint and the prescription of our lenses. Our lenses being the set of values, beliefs, biases and assumptions that come out of our birth culture, the additional impact of our specific personal experiences, and conscious and unconscious choices made from all those sets of experiences. We can even take off one set of cultural values and replace them with a completely new tinted lens. This is what happens when we convert from one ideology or culture to another. We leave behind the ideas and metaphors that were dominant in one culture for a new set that we have converted too. The act of conversion is built upon a pre-existing set of ideas. Conversion is a shift in importance and a shift in the chromatic nature of the collection of previously held ideas—the old ideas mutate or undergo a metamorphosis into something new.</p><p>To be a human is to understand the Territory in a human way, through the lens of the culture that we have been exposed to. This process of being shaped is how we come to wear our specific set of tinted lenses at every given moment of our lives.</p><p>All humans have been shaped by ideas. All ideas came from humans who were shaped by ideas. The set of ideas that make up the tint and prescription of our glasses is the cognitive box we live in. The set of ideas that makes up the tint of our glasses are the cognitive tools we use to explore and understand the Territory of the external and our internal world.</p><p>In the end, we never understand experience directly and untainted by our past. By this statement, I mean that we never come to understand an experience that doesn’t go through the unconscious and subconscious brain/mind, the second and third levels of the brain/mind. In this process, the experience gets shaped by those filters. All of our understanding of experience is affected by, and thus shaped by, the ideas we have stored in our mind. Never forget that at birth we begin our exposure to a specific human language and thus the culture that the language sustains. Every language sustains a different human culture. We are shaped by ideas and we shape these ideas as we live out our lives. My phrase describes the dynamic relationship of ideas and sensory data coming into our mind/body.</p><p>My phrase describes a dynamic process that is true for all humans. Anyone you choose to name, was shaped, and is shaped, by ideas. Whether it is for example: Osama Ben Laden, Adolf Hitler, Aristotle, Alfred Korzybski, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Muhammad, Siddhartha Gautama (who became known as The Buddha), Lao Tzu, you, me, etc., every human who ever lived and will ever live shapes and is shaped by ideas. There are no exceptions.</p><p>Although we interact through our senses directly with the world around us, when it comes to conscious interaction with the world, in a very real way we do not understand the experience of our world directly, but do so through our tinted glasses. Those ideas we have come to incorporate into our accepted system of beliefs become part of our new lenses. Every human, past, present and future, all of us were, are, and will be, shaped by ideas. Using those past acquisitions of ideas, we all shape our own current and future ideas. We literally may only see and hear what we believe we should, and want to, see and hear.</p><p>My studies have been concerned with this relationship of ideas and the individuals being shaped by them. It is the guiding principle in my quest to build my metaphysical philosophy. My phrase is concerned with analyzing the origins of ideas within an individual human’s mind and a culture’s collective conscious and unconsciousness.</p><p>To truly understand an idea, I believe we must reflect on, and consider, the human who created that idea. We must investigate the tint of the lenses that this specific individual human creator wears. We need to acknowledge the box that every individual thinker inhabits.</p><p>Suggest Readings:</p><p><em>The Second Sex</em> by Simone de Beauvoir</p><p><em>The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man’s Changing Vision of the Universe</em> by Arthur Koestler</p><p><em>Science and the Modern World</em> by Alfred North Whitehead</p><p><em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> by Thomas S.
