<p>Fourth entry: August 8 2016</p><p>Korzybski: Maps and the Territory</p><p>One of the most important orienting concepts inspired by the writings of Alfred Korzybski is the terms, and the relationship between the terms, maps and Territory. The term territory beginning with a lower case letter t refers to any single specific empirical and actual geographic location. Whereas the term Territory with an upper case letter t refers to the to the complete and entire space-time empirical existence, it refers to the infinite universe in all its dimensions. The term maps refer to any and all attempt to describe any aspect of the Territory by the use of any and all symbols or collections of symbols. Therefore the term maps can refer to a single word or a single symbol, or picture, etc. as well as referring to a collection of words and or symbols. Maps are crafted to describe some finite aspect of the infinite Territory.</p><p>Let me now present some excerpts from Korzybski’s book Science and Sanity wherein he describes his idea behind maps and map making and I will comment on those excerpts.</p><p>Science and Sanity: Part II: General on Structure, Chapter IV: On Structure</p><p>”One of the fundamental functions of ‘mental’ processes is to distinguish. We distinguish objects by certain characteristics, which are usually expressed by adjectives. If, by a higher order abstraction, we consider individual objects, not is some perfectly fictitious ‘isolation’, but as they appear empirically, as members of some aggregate or collection of objects, we find characteristics which belong to the collection and not to an ‘isolated’ object. Such characteristics as arise from the fact that the object belongs to a collection are called ‘relations’.</p><p>In such collections, we have the possibility of ordering the objects…There are many ways in which we can order a collection, and many relations which we can find. It is important to notice that ‘order’ and ‘relations’ are, for the most part, empirically present and that, therefore, this language is fit to represent the facts as we know them. The structure of the actual world is such that it is impossible entirely to isolate an object. An A[ristotelian] subject-predicate language, with its tendency to treat objects as in isolation and to have no place for relations (impossible in complete ‘isolation’), obviously has a structure not similar to the structure of the world, in which we deal only with collections, of which the members are related.</p><p>Obviously, under such empirical conditions, only a language originating in the analysis of collections, and, therefore, a language of ‘relations’, ‘order’ etc., would have a similar structure to the world around us.” (P. 56-57 )</p><p>Korzybski starts by noticing that we observe and experience the world around us, this would include noticing our own body and internal feelings. We experience the world first non-verbally. Then we attempt at a later moment in time to reflect on that non-verbal experience and by reflection attempt to understand and therefore to describe to ourselves what we experienced. In doing this we process the non-verbal experience into a verbal description. We have to isolate a finite set of data to pay attention to out of the infinite collection of data available to us. We can only process a finite amount of data we physically/biologically are incapable of processing an infinite amount of data at any one moment in time.</p><p>In processing this data, we selectively focus on a specific set of non-verbal objects and we isolate those objects in an imaginative arrangement. We notice the relationships of objects to each other and to ourselves. This process of paying attention to a finite select set of data and noticing their interrelationships can be described as making a map. The potential and actual set of relationships amongst all of the objects is infinite, just as there are an infinite number of objects potentially available to be noticed. Since we can only process a finite collection, we are always engaged in selecting and isolating objects and data to consider at any one time.</p><p>The important thing for us to attempt is to correctly and accurately notice and describe the relationships between the objects. We attempt to find order and structure and we hope that the order and structure that we imagine we have noticed and describe actually and accurately matches the order and structure found in the world. We hope and believe that our descriptions of reality, our maps are accurate although finite rendering of the infinite Territory.</p><p>”Two important characteristics of maps should be noticed. A map is not the territory it represents, but if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness. … <br>If we reflect upon our languages, we find that at best they must be considered only as maps.” (P.58)</p><p>The phrase ‘the maps is not the territory it represents’ refers to the difference between our symbolic finite creation and the non-symbolic space-time collection of objects we are attempting to pay attention to. It further refers to an important distinction to be noticed between our finite symbol renderings, our maps, and the infinite non-symbolic things. Maps are representations of the physical objects. The physical objects we can direct interact with our senses whereas the maps are only an artificial symbolic representation of the relationships that we experienced using our senses. I believe that Korzybski is using the term language metaphorically to refer to any and all system of symbols.</p><p>”As words are not the objects which they represent, structure, and structure alone, becomes the only link which connects our verbal processes with the empirical data.” (P. 59)</p><p>”The structure of the world is, in principle, unknown; and the only aim of knowledge and science is to discover this structure. The structure of languages is potentially known, if we pay attention to it. Our only possible procedure in advancing our knowledge is to match our verbal structures, often called theories, with empirical structures, and see if our verbal predictions are fulfilled empirically or not, thus indication that the two structures are either similar or dissimilar.” ( P.63)</p><p>I believe Korzybski’s use of the term ‘words’ is his term for components of any symbol system. The term ‘language’ is his term for the overall symbol system an example would be mathematics, geometry, etc. For Korzybski ‘verbal structures’ were the equivalent of theories. I therefore believe that all of the following, words, language, verbal structures, theories, models, concepts, and ideas, are all examples of either simply or complex maps. They are all finite static means to describe and understand aspects of the infinite Territory.</p><p>We humans are mapmakers and map users.</p><p>Since the Territory is infinite that means it would take an infinite number of finite maps to attempt to describe that totality. It also means the process of mapmaking is never complete. No single map can fully describe the Territory. All maps are merely a finite attempt to understand and describe a finite portion of some of the relationships that the map maker wanted to point out and describe.</p><p>Works Cited</p><p>Korzybski, Alfred.
