## _**1
CE - 900 CE. a timeline of natural light, the hidden light, and the
ever-present darkness in the Western World**_**. **

**35**
Paul of Tarus sees Jesus in mystical vision on the road to Damascus.

**40-44** Rule of Herod Agrippa. Philo of Alexandria flourishes
integration of Judahean and proto-Jewish religious thinking and Platonism,
developing/creating Biblical commentary on the Biblical text, blending Jewish
Deity with Greek concept of Logos.

**44**
Emperor Claudius returns Palestine to Roman provincial status.

**44-66** Unrest in Palestine by Judaheans and Pharisees instigators.

**48**
Council of Apostles at Jerusalem recognizes Paul's mission to Gentiles.

**50-60** Letters of Paul composed

May **66**: Procurator Florus
desecrates Temple and then rebels lead by Eleasar son of High Priest occupies
Temple.

**66-70**:
The Great Jewish Revolt against Roman occupation ended with destruction of the
Second Temple and the fall of Jerusalem. 1,100,000 people are killed by the
Romans during the siege, and 97,000 captured and enslaved. The Sanhedrin was
relocated to Yavne by Yochanan ben Zakai, see also Council of Jamnia. Fiscus
Judaicus levied on all Jews of the Roman Empire whether they aided the revolt
or not.

**64-68** Apostles Peter and Paul killed in Rome by Nero's rule.

**70**:
Jerusalem Temple razed by Rome. Thus ends power base of Priest who become the Sadducees.
They compete with the Pharisees Rabbis and their ascendency, Triumph of
Judaism. Rabbi Yohanan Ben Zakkai gets permission, according to Rabbinic
legend, to build a 'school' in the city of Yahveh. The start of Mishnah in Oral
form that leads to the Talmud in written form. Rabbinic Judaism is now the only
power base. The Rule of Rabbinic/Talmudic Constitutional Law of the Jewish
People.

Following the destruction of the
Temple, Rome governed Judea through a Procurator at Caesarea and a Jewish
Patriarch. A former leading Pharisee, Yohanan ben Zakkai, was appointed the
first Patriarch (the Hebrew word, Nasi, also means prince, or president), and
he reestablished the Sanhedrin at Javneh under Pharisee control. Instead of
giving tithes to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the Temple, the
rabbis instructed Jews to give money to charities and study in local
Synagogues, as well as to pay the Fiscus Iudaicus. The Merkavah (Chariot
metaphor taken from the book of Ezekiel) riders, a form of Jewish Mysticism
flourishes among a select group of Rabbis. The legend of the four who ventured
to PaRDeS (the Garden aka paradise aka the heavenly throne), amongst that four
was Rabbi Akiva. The invention of the dual Torah system, the Written Text of
the Torah (and the rest of the Scriptures) and the Oral Torah (the teachings of
the Rabbis). The legend of Oral Torah at Sinai. This story explains why the
Rabbis have the authority to decide and interpret Torah. The story of how the
revelation and authority to interpret the Law was passed down in Oral Tradition
from Moses to the Rabbis. All that the Rabbis wrote and teach was given at
Sinai, so the story goes.

**70--200** Period of the Tannaim, rabbis who organized and elucidated the Jewish oral law. The decisions of the Tannaim are contained in the Mishnah, Beraita, Tosefta, and
various Midrash compilations.

**73** Final events of the Great Jewish
Revolt -- the fall of Masada. Christianity starts off as a Jewish sect and then
develops its own texts and ideology and branches off from Judaism to become a
distinct religion.

**100** Nicomachus's Introduction to Arithmetic. Gnostic religions
and theologies flourish

**109** Tacitus's Historiae written. (Notes that the leader of the
followers of Jesus was executed by Roman law by crucifixion.)

**110 **Plutarch flourishes, writes Parallel Lives, comparative biographies
of prominent Greeks and Romans.

**115--117** Kitos War
(Revolt against Trajan) -- a second Jewish-Roman War initiated in large Jewish
communities of Cyprus, Cyrene (modern Libya), Aegipta (modern Egypt) and
Mesopotamia (modern Syria and Iraq). It led to mutual killing of hundreds of
thousands Jews, Greeks and Romans, ending with a total defeat of Jewish rebels
and complete extermination of Jews in Cyprus and Cyrene by the newly installed
Emperor Hadrian.

**120** Epicetus flourishes, Stoic moralist.

**132**: The Emperor Hadrian threatened to rebuild Jerusalem as a
pagan city dedicated to Jupiter, called Aelia Capitolina. Some of the leading
sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion (and, for a short time, an
independent state) led by Simon bar Kozeba (also called Bar Kochba, or
"son of a star"); some, such as Rabbi Akiba, believed Bar Kochbah to
be messiah, or king. Up until this time, a number of Christians were still part
of the Jewish community. However, they did not support or take part in the
revolt. Whether because they had no wish to fight, or because they could not
support a second messiah in addition to Jesus, or because of their harsh
treatment by Bar Kochba during his brief reign, these Christians also left the
Jewish community around this time.

**135**: This revolt ended in when Bar Kochba and his army were
defeated. The Romans then barred Jews from Jerusalem, until Constantine allowed
Jews to enter for one day each year, during the holiday of Tisha B'Av.

**136 **Rabbi Akiva executed by the Romans

**138** With Emperor Hadrian's death, the persecution of Jews within the Roman Empire is
eased and Jews are allowed to visit Jerusalem on Tisha B'av. In the following
centuries the Jewish center moves to Galilee.

**140 **Ptolemey's Almagest and Terabiblos codify classical
astronomy and astrology.

**161** Marcus Aurelius becomes emperor of Rome.

**170** Galen advances science of medicine.

**180** Irenaeus's _Against Heresies_ criticizes Gnosticism.

**Circa 200**: After the suppression of the revolt the vast majority of
Jews were sent into exile; shortly thereafter. Judah haNasi edited together
judgments and traditions into an authoritative code, the Mishnah. This marks
the completed transformation of Pharisaic Judaism into full blown Rabbinic
Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism is based on the interpretation of Halakah, the Law. _Corpus
Hermeticum_ compiled in Alexandria (approximate). Although the Rabbis traced
their origins to the Pharisees, Rabbinic Judaism nevertheless involved a
radical repudiation of certain elements of Pharisaism---elements that were basic
to Second Temple Judaism. The Pharisees had been partisan. Members of different
sects argued with one another over the correctness of their respective
interpretations. After the destruction of the Second Temple, these sectarian
divisions ended. The term "Pharisee" was no longer used, perhaps
because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the
term was explicitly sectarian. The Rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews, and
added to the Amidah the birkat haMinim (see Council of Jamnia held at Yahveh.),
a prayer which in part exclaims, "Praised are You O Lord, who breaks
enemies and defeats the arrogant," and which is understood as a rejection
of sectarians and sectarianism. This shift by no means resolved conflicts over
the interpretation of the Torah; rather, it relocated debates between sects to
debates within Rabbinic Judaism

During the time of the Composition
of the Talmud, references are noted in the eventual text of a book assumed to
be the _Sefer Yetzirah_ and the study and use made of it by groups of
Rabbis engaged in mystical studies. The historical origin of the _Sefer
Yetzirah_ was placed by Reitzenstein (Poimandres, p. 291) in the 2nd century
BCE. According to Christopher P. Benton, the Hebrew grammatical form places its
origin closer to the period of the Mishna, around the 2nd century CE.

**220--500** Period of

the Temple's destruction.. 

**325**: Council of Nicaea convened by Constantine establishes
orthodox Christian doctrine.

Despite sporadic periods of persecution, Jewish communal and cultural life
flowered in this period. The universally recognized centers of Jewish life were
in Jerusalem and Tiberias (Syria), Sura and Pumbeditha (Iraq). The heads of
these law schools were the Gaonim, who were consulted on matters of law by Jews
throughout the world. During this time, the Niqqud is invented in Tiberias.

**711** Muslim armies invade and occupy most of Spain (At this time Jews made up about 8% of Spain's population). Under Christian rule, Jews had been subject to frequent
and intense persecution, which was formalized under Muslim rule due to the
dhimmi rules in Islam. Jews and Christians had to pay the jizya. Some sources
