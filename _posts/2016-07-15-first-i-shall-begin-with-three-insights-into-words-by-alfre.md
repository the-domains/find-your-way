I shall begin with three insights into words by Alfred Korzybski, from _Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics_, (original copyright 1933) International Non-Aristotelian Library Publishing Company, 4th ed. 5th 1973 printing.

"_The objective level is not words, cannot be reached by words alone, and has nothing to do with 'good' or 'bad'; neither can it be understood as 'non-expressible by words' or 'not to be described by words', because the terms 'expressible' or 'described' already presuppose words and symbols. Something, therefore, which we call 'a chair' or 'a toothache' may be expressed or described by words; yet, the situation is not altered, because the given description or expression will not be the objective level which we call 'a chair' or 'a toothache'._" (p. 34)

I believe that Korzybski is saying that nonverbal things found on the objective/publicly accessible level of space-time could only be reached and experienced first by non-verbal means. Words of any sort will not directly connect you with things. It is not that words are lacking, it is just that words are not the sensory objects that can be experienced. We experience first nonverbally and then we verbally begin to process all that we encountered in order to understand what just happened and what it means.

Korzybski's second insight, "_I want to make clear only that words are not the things spoken about, and that there is no such thing as an object in absolute isolation._" (p. 50)

I take this to refer to the fact that words act as symbolic placeholders pointing towards objects on a continuum of abstract to concrete. Words that point toward concrete terms are the non-verbal things found in space-time. Whereas abstract words point to concepts that are not found in space-time but rather found in people's conceptual imaginings. Also, note the fact that no single thing is in isolation, which I believe means that the universe functions as a dynamic interconnected flux of part/whole infinite collection of things.

Korzybski's third insight is about words being involved in the process of mapmaking. "_We must realize that structure, and structure alone is the only link between languages and the empirical world._" (p. 50) 

I take this to refer to the idea that our finite minds can only abstract, from the flux of reality that we encounter, a limited finite set of data. This data has a corresponding relationship via a similarity of structure that we impose on this abstracted data set. This relationship corresponds to the structure we believe is found in the space-time of the Territory. This is a fancy way to say that in order to describe and understand reality, aka The Territory, we make maps.
