Understanding the idea of a Deity with limited power/ability.

April 25, 2017

Pantheism = Assumption that the deity is modeled on the biological workings of a human being. It has a body that has the emergent property/ability that we can call a mind/soul/spirt. The deity is the mind/soul/spirit of the universe.  (Henceforth
for the sake of this discussion, I will refer to this attribute by the term 'mind'.)

1)     Fact: The human body and the human mind relationship is one in which the mind has only limited control over all aspects of the body.

2)     Therefore, based on this analogy, the mind of the universe has limited control over the body of the universe.

Panentheism = Assumption that the deity is again modeled on the biology of a human being. Now a further assumption is that there are two entities. One entity is a body (aka the universe) and the other a mind that is different and separate from the body. (Note: I have just create a cosmic version of the 'mind -- body problem'; refer to Descartes, for one
example, for some of those issues and problems.)

1)   Next assumption: the deity's mind controls completely its body and all its workings. Another way to say 'complete control' is to say that this deity is/has omniscience and omnipotence. 

2)     Next assumption: The deity is the source of Goodness, Kindness, Justice, Love, etc. As in the deity as described by Christianity, Islam, or Judaism.

a.     Results in the problem of Evil aka Theodicy.

3)      To resolve the problem of Evil/Theodicy replace assumption \#1 with:  this mind only partial or has limited control over its body.

A) That results in no problem of Evil. Evil is simply what occurs when events take place that the mind doesn't like and cannot either foresee and/or lacks the ability to do anything about, due to the inherent limits of mind's control over the body.

Therefore, to avoid the whole Evil problem you posit either the Pantheistic deity modeled on the human body or you posit the Panentheistic limited deity.
