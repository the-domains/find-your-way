  ‘The reality of everyday life is taken for granted as reality. It does not
  require additional verification over and beyond its simple presence. It is
  simply there, as self-evident and compelling facticity. I know that it is
  real. While I am capable of engaging in doubt about its reality, I am obliged
  to suspend such doubt as I routinely exist in everyday life. This suspension
  of doubt is so firm that to abandon it, as I might want to do, say, in
  theoretical or religious contemplation, I have to make an extreme transition.
  The world of everyday life proclaims itself and, when I want to challenge the
  proclamation, I must engage in a deliberate, by no means easy effort.’

'The reality of everyday life is taken for granted _as _reality. It does not require additional verification over and beyond its simple presence. It is simply _there_, as self-evident and compelling facticity. I _know _that it is real. While I am capable of engaging in doubt about its reality, I am obliged to suspend such doubt as I routinely exist in everyday life. This suspension of doubt is so firm that to abandon it, as I might want to do, say, in theoretical or religious contemplation, I have to make an extreme transition. The world of everyday life proclaims itself and, when I want to challenge the proclamation, I must engage in a deliberate, by no means easy effort.'

From Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann's _The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge,_ original copyright 1966, Anchor Book Edition 1967, 23-24
