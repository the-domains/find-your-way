A few of my guiding principles:

**1) People shape and are shaped by ideas. **\[A revelation I had when I was nine years old and has guided my life's intellectual and spiritual journey every since.\]

**2) The beginning of wisdom is the realization that you might be mistaken; mistaken in your observations, your analysis, and/or your conclusions.**

**3) Unexpected invitations are dancing lessons from the Divine.**
