## _The Tao that can be spoken about is not the same as the actual Tao_

\[philosophic translation of the first line of the Tao Te Ching by G M Jaron\]

The Territory is non-symbolic infinitely interconnected and dynamically vast-a multitude of undifferentiated stuff.

We map it out.

We demarcated it.

We name it.

We create it as a thing that we claim to understand to some extent.

Goodness, truth, beauty, justice, evil, the divine, God, Satan, are all things we created. They were and are the stuff of the Tao/Territory that we spoke and speak about.

Those words are some of our maps.
