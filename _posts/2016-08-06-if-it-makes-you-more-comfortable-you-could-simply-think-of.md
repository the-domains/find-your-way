  If it makes you more comfortable, you could simply think of it as metaphor.
  Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a
  woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who
  left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves youâ€”even, perhaps,
  against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure
  your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers. and
  triumphs over all opposition.

If it makes you more comfortable, you could simply think of it as metaphor.   
Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you---even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers. and triumphs over all opposition.

Religions are places to stand and look and act, vantage points from which to view the world.
