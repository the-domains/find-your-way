Maya, Solipsism, Idealism, Brains in a vat, the Matrix, the illusion of the physical universe

Okay, we are born.

From that fact we can deduce that an newborn infant has the potential to know any human language, however the fact is that at that at birth we have to be taught everything and anything that is a part of being human. We have to be socialized into a specific nurturing culture and the communal social culture that the birth family is a member of.

We are born into the Territory.

However, we have to be taught to be human and act like a human.

We have to be taught about maps, map making, and map using.

Until we learn a human language and can actually speak and say words and make sentences, we are operating at or below the level of say our pet cat or dog.

The reality of the physical world is never questioned by a cat, dog, or any other animal. They are a part of the Territory and they interact with the Territory on a non-verbal level without any doubt or question.

To question or doubt the reality of the physical world is something a person has to be taught, it does not come naturally.

The ideas of Hinduism and Buddhism, and all the other philosophic concepts that disbelieve in the existence of the physical world, all of these ideas and beliefs had to be taught to a child, or an adult, who is being socialized into those cultures.

The question shouldn't be is the Territory real? 

The real question is why would anyone want to make up the idea that the physical universe is not real?

What is/was their motivation? 

What individual and/or cultural need did that idea/map serve?
