Plato put into the mouth of Socrates:

\[From _Apology_ 38a\]

"_and if again I say that to talk every day about virtue and the other things about which you hear me talking and examining myself and others is the greatest good to man, **and that the unexamined life is not worth living...** "_

Translation from _Plato in Twelve Volumes_, Vol. 1 translated by **Harold North Fowler**; Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1966\.
