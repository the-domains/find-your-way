## _Why are you here?_

I believe that creator, the infinite Divine, aka the Tao aka
Ayn Sof, needs us.

I believe that the act of creation did not go as planned.

I believe that the act of creation led to the cosmos being
flawed and in a state of disharmony.

I believe that sentient beings were created to help restore harmony,
although this is a choice that each one of us has to make throughout our
lifetime.

We are needed by the infinite Divine/ Tao/ Ayn Sof to
restore harmony to ourselves, to the cosmos and to the Divine / Tao/ Ayn Sof.

This task that we may choose to participate in is called in
Hebrew: Tikkun Olam. That phrase means in English, to heal / to restore/ to
repair / the World aka the cosmos.

You are here because you are needed to contribute to this
cosmic need.

You are here to assist in restoring, repairing, and healing
yourself, the cosmos and the Divine.

You can do this at every moment of your life.

You can do this by any act of goodness, truth, beauty,
justice, and harmony.

Will you answer the call of the Divine?

Will you help?

And if not now, when?
