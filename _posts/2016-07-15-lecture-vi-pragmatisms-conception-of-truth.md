From: _**Pragmatism**_

(orig. copyright 1907) Harvard University Press, 1978 ed.

**Lecture VI Pragmatism's Conception of Truth**

_...the classic stages of a theory's career. First...a new theory is attacked as absurd; then it is admitted to be true, but obvious and insignificant; finally it is seen to be so important that its adversaries claim that they themselves discovered it_. (p. 95)

_Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their 'agreement' as falsity means their disagreement, with 'reality'. Pragmatists and intellectualists both accept this definition as a matter of course. They begin to quarrel only after the question is raised as to what my precisely be meant by the term 'agreement', and what by the term 'reality', when reality is taken as something for our ideas to agree with._ (p. 96)

_But the great assumption of the intellectualists is that truth means essentially an inert static relation. When you've got our true idea of anything, there's an end of the matter. You're in possession; you know; you have fulfilled your thinking destiny. (96) ...The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process: the process namely of its verifying itself, its veri-fication. Its validity is the process of its valid-ation. _(p. 97)

_Meanwhile we have to live today by what truth we can get today, and be ready tomorrow to call it falsehood. Ptolemaic astronomy, Euclidean space, aristotelian logic, scholastic metaphysics, were expedient for centuries, but human experience has boiled over those limits, and we now call these things only relatively true, or true within those borders of experience. 'Absolutely' they are false; for we know that those limits were casual, and might have been transcended by past theorists just as they are by present thinkers._ (p. 107)
