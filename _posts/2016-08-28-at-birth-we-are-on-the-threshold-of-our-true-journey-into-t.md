At birth, we are on the threshold of our true journey into the human community.

We are uncarved blocks awaiting artisans' hands and insights.

From the moment of creation, we are potential.

At that moment, how we unfold and where we wander was shaped by unseen and unknown factors.

But not unknowable.

The shaping by those factors is hidden deep in the darkness of the unconscious mind.

If we truly want to know ourselves, to truly find our way, we need to bring those factors that shaped us into the light of the conscious mind, in a place where we can make conscious use of them.
