At birth, you are on the threshold of your true journey into the human community.

You are uncarved blocks awaiting artisans' hands and insights.

From the moment of creation, you are potential.

At that moment, how you unfold and where you will wander was shaped by unseen factors.

But not unknowable.

The shaping by those factors is hidden deep in the darkness of your unconscious minds.

If we truly want to know ourselves, you need to bring those factors that shaped you into the light of your conscious mind. By doing this, you can make conscious use of them to change who you are and to help you to find your way.
