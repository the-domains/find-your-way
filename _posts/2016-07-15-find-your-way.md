Find Your Way

This site will explain and explore a Pragmatic Orienting Philosophy. 

A way to understand your self and where you come from. Once you have insight into who you are you, what ideas shaped you, what things and people from your past and from the culture you were raised in you will have insights into your unconscious biases which perhaps now can be brought into the light of conscious awareness.

You need to now where you came from and where you are now to figure out how to find your way towards where you are going.
