Thus ends power base of Priest aka Sadducees(?) who now compete with the Pharisees Rabbis and their ascendency, Triumph of Judaism

Rabbi Yohanan Ben Zakkai gets permission, according to Rabbinic legend, to build a 'school' in the city of Yahveh. The start of Mishnah in Oral form that leads to the Talmud in written form. Rabbinic Judaism is now the only power base. The Rule of Rabbinic/Talmudic Constitutional Law of the Jewish People.

Following the destruction of the Temple, Rome governed Judea through a Procurator at Caesarea and a Jewish Patriarch. A former leading Pharisee, Yohanan ben Zakkai, was appointed the first Patriarch (the Hebrew word, Nasi, also means prince, or president), and he reestablished the Sanhedrin at Javneh under Pharisee control. Instead of giving tithes to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the Temple, the rabbis instructed Jews to give money to charities and study in local Synagogues, as well as to pay the Fiscus Iudaicus. The Merkavah (Chariot metaphor taken from the book of Ezekiel) riders, a form of Jewish Mysticism flourishes among a select group of Rabbis. The legend of the four who ventured to PaRDeS (the Garden aka paradise aka the heavenly throne), amongst that four was Rabbi Akiva. The invention of the dual Torah system, the Written Text of the Torah (and the rest of the Scriptures) and the Oral Torah (the teachings of the Rabbis). The legend of Oral Torah at Sinai. This story explains why the Rabbis have the authority to decide and interpret Torah. The story of how the revelation and authority to interpret the Law was passed down in Oral Tradition from Moses to the Rabbis. All that the Rabbis wrote and teach was given at Sinai, so the story goes.

**132**: The Emperor Hadrian threatened to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city dedicated to Jupiter, called Aelia Capitolina. Some of the leading sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion (and, for a short time, an independent state) led by Simon bar Kozeba (also called Bar Kochba, or "son of a star"); some, such as Rabbi Akiba, believed Bar Kochbah to be messiah, or king. Up until this time, a number of Christians were still part of the Jewish community. However, they did not support or take part in the revolt. Whether because they had no wish to fight, or because they could not support a second messiah in addition to Jesus, or because of their harsh treatment by Bar Kochba during his brief reign, these Christians also left the Jewish community around this time.

**135**: This revolt ended in when Bar Kochba and his army were defeated. The Romans then barred Jews from Jerusalem, until Constantine allowed Jews to enter for one day each year, during the holiday of Tisha B'Av.

**161** Marcus Aurelius becomes emperor of Rome.

**170** Galen advances science of medicine.

**180** Irenaeus's _Against Heresies_ criticizes Gnosticism.

**Circa 200**: After the suppression of the revolt the vast majority of Jews were sent into exile; shortly thereafter. Judah haNasi edited together judgments and traditions into an authoritative code, the Mishnah. This marks the completed transformation of Pharisaic Judaism into full blown Rabbinic Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism is based on the interpretation of Halakah, the Law. _Corpus Hermeticum_ compiled in Alexandria (approximate).

Although the Rabbis traced their origins to the Pharisees, Rabbinic Judaism nevertheless involved a radical repudiation of certain elements of Pharisaism---elements that were basic to Second Temple Judaism. The Pharisees had been partisan. Members of different sects argued with one another over the correctness of their respective interpretations, see also Hillel and Shammai. After the destruction of the Second Temple, these sectarian divisions ended. The term "Pharisee" was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian. The Rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews, and added to the Amidah the birkat haMinim (see Council of Jamnia held at Yahveh.), a prayer which in part exclaims, "Praised are You O Lord, who breaks enemies and defeats the arrogant," and which is understood as a rejection of sectarians and sectarianism. This shift by no means resolved conflicts over the interpretation of the Torah; rather, it relocated debates between sects to debates within Rabbinic Judaism

During the time of the Composition of the Talmud, references are noted in the eventual text of a book assumed to be the _Sefer Yetzirah_ and the study and use made of it by groups of Rabbis engaged in mystical studies. The historical origin of the _Sefer Yetzirah_ was placed by Reitzenstein (Poimandres, p. 291) in the 2nd century BCE. According to Christopher P. Benton, the Hebrew grammatical form places its origin closer to the period of the Mishna, around the 2nd century CE.
