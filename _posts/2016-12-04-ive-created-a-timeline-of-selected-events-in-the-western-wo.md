  Iâ€™ve created a timeline of selected events in the Western World. It starts
  before the common era of our time with the beginnings of the Hebrews and
  follows their history until it intersects with the events that shaped the
  Western world with the coming of the Roman empire. The timelines include
  events in the history of science particularly as western natural philosopher
  and scientists try to understand what is light. It also follows the
  developments of Western music, a selection of literature as well. It follows
  the development of Jewish mysticism, and the Western Occult tradition as well.
  Lastly I added the ongoing acts against the Jewish people in the Western
  world. I call these timelines the history of the natural light, the hidden
  light and the ever present darkness.

I've created a timeline of selected events in the Western World. It starts before the common era of our time with the beginnings of the Hebrews and follows their history until it intersects with the events that shaped the Western world with the coming of the Roman empire. The timelines include events in the history of science particularly as western natural philosopher and scientists try to understand what is light. It also follows the developments of Western music, a selection of literature as well. It follows the development of Jewish mysticism, and the Western Occult tradition as well. Lastly I added the ongoing acts against the Jewish people in the Western world. I call these timelines the history of the natural light, the hidden light and the ever present darkness.
