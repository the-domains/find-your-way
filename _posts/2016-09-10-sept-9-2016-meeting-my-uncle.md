Sept 9 2016: A Meeting with my Uncle

Last night I met up with my Uncle Herbie and Aunt Ginny at my parent's house in San Francisco. They had flown in to the City from New Jersey to celebrate his, my Dad's and my wife, Cedar's, birthdays.

Herbie had checked out this website blog and told me he didn't get it. "I don't understand what's going on. I don't understand what your trying to do. I just don't understand it."

Well that's not good.

Herbie is a retired guy, has a Business degree, extremely well read, a highly literate guy and if he doesn't get it, well I just need to start over and get it right this time.

So....I stripped it down to start over.

My next post will be a guide so that you understand what to expect and why you should bother to come here, I hope I can get you back.

Stay tuned.
