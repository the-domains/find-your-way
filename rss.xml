            <title><![CDATA[The Vision of Micah….a time without religious strife.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/379f43e6-e323-4bfe-8111-6684fbe82337.jpg">,<h2><em>The Vision of Micah….a time without religious strife.</em></h2>,<p>To understand what I am about to tell you may require you to suspend what you believe you already know. What you know will more than likely act as a filter and prevent you from considering something new. Can you suspend belief?</p>,<p>Micah was a prophet during the years 739 through 693 BCE, during the reigns of three kings of Judah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Christians, Muslims, and even Jews, despite the fact that all three recognize that prophets such as Micah are considered valid speakers of the Divine’s truth to humanity, generally overlook one of Micah’s prophecies. Micah’s description of the end of days is similar to Isaiah’s, but with a very significant difference; the difference I believe is why his message is so often ignored.</p>,<p>The vision of Micah that I wish to focus on leaves behind the voice of the genocidal God and the concept of herem that is depicted in the Book of <em>Deuteronomy</em> and the Book of <em>Samuel</em> and instead proclaims a new way to walk with God.</p>,<p>His prophecy is important, and its significance has implications for all religions, though only Judaism, Christianity, and Islam believe that the Hebrew prophets convey a message from the Infinite Divine. I will cite in full the first five verses of chapter four; I will use the Jewish Publication Society’s 1955 translation. I suggest that you compare it with your favorite English translation.</p>,<p><em>1. But in the end of days it shall come to pass, That the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established as the top of the mountains, And it shall be exalted above the hills; And peoples shall flow unto it.</em></p>,<p><em>2. And many nations shall go and say: ‘Come ye, and let us to up to the mountain of the Lord, And to the house of the God of Jacob; And He will teach us of His ways, And we will walk in His paths; For out of Zion shall go forth the law, And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</em></p>,<p><em>3. And He shall judge between many peoples, And shall decide concerning mighty nations afar off; And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruning-hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war any more.</em></p>,<p><em>4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; And none shall make them afraid; For the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken.</em></p>,<p><em>5. For let all the peoples walk each one is the name of its god, But we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.</em></p>,<p>Micah described a time when nations shall give up war and turn the implements of war into the implements of peaceful agriculture; when people will still toil in their vineyard and in their orchards, but they will no longer be afraid. How and why does this all come about? What is the key element that will change to transform humanity from a war like existence to one of peace?</p>,<p>I believe Micah’s answers this question in his fifth verse.</p>,<p>Throughout the history prior to Micah, the land we in the West call the Middle East has always been a place ravaged by war. Wars were waged by rulers who proclaimed that they were acting in the name of their gods, or more simply, proclaimed that they were gods themselves and thus all should bow down to them. War and religion were intricately tied together, and thus religion was the rationale for all the wars and conquests throughout the Middle East.</p>,<p>To imagine a time of peace would logically mean a time when there would no longer be the proclaimed reason for war—which was that one god needed to dominate all other gods and those who worship other gods. Religious intolerance is the often stated reason for going to war.</p>,<p>I read Micah’s prophecy as an amazingly logical presentation. An amazingly realistic conception of the end of days when the world would be without fear and people would work in their vineyards and orchards. Micah envisions that the world embroiled in war is a world filled with religious intolerance. Therefore a world without war is a world where there exists the complete opposite of the status quo of world ruled by intolerance, a world of universal religious tolerance: ‘<em>For let all the peoples walk each one is the name of its god</em>’.</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkUFPwzAMhe_9FVGRWCutCSAhIdruMIkDl12AE0IoS5wt3ZpUcVqoEP8ddyuIWxx_es9-rrQdmNV1arZF8D6mq0rQ1yqpUAXbxVVmeqei9S7TS4ZLYnP2lTA2yMAaqk2DrGaa7yA-HKEFF3E9PsvdRraQYf569VYSbQ3L_jPr8VFnJJWzALEPbmJmIRVARpg5Uiipwa2mntVnjGNQVKZCKO8cqMiNVLD1_sAdRAHu_eVJoD7wBi8-zbY91teXAwSkJerhht-lkwzNzTsZyGPjNXDrEEJcg_EBsnmvvEy-M-1VP02yZItzIgt6_foVDZLPIs_LSsx5JUk1RaqOEvGUqvLtKZWUaRllsQ9g6nQfY4f3QsQ97ILVXFphrNPF6PtQfMhRzLTr285jJKXbv8v8ANFaj7U" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

it therefore means that it can only be experienced directly via the senses and
this experience is non-symbolic. Symbols are attributed to that experience as
we attempt to understand what happened to us.</p>,<p>Maps are metaphorically symbols, relationships of symbols and systems of symbols.</p>,<p>All maps are finite, static and linear.</p>,<p>The Territory is infinite, dynamic, non-linear, multi-layered and multidimensional.</p>,<p>Therefore any map we make is, as Korzybski noted, cannot be the Territory. We can eat the non-symbolic thing we call an apple, we cannot eat the symbol that is denoted by the word ‘apple’.</p>,<p>Therefore all our maps, our theories and descriptions of the events and processes of reality that I call the Territory are not equivalent. Maps, at best, point toward aspects of the Territory.</p>,<p>Many of the great thinkers do not understand this.</p>,<p>They, these great thinkers, write as if they are directly describing the working of the Territory. However their maps are not the Territory. At best they point toward the Territory and if they are valid and useful they can be verified and help us to find our way.</p>,<p>This error of believing that they are directly describing the Territory is a common one.</p>,<p>Their maps are always incomplete and by their finite nature leave many things out.</p>,<p>Yet the great minds have the hubris to think that their maps are the Territory.</p>,<p>Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Hegel, Whitehead, to name a few of the great mapmakers, all think that what they are describing is true, is accurate, is complete description of the workings of the Territory. </p>,<p>This is not the case.</p>,<p>They are only making their own map and working within a map of their own creation. They are only describing their own creation and not the reality of the working of the Territory.</p>,<p>At best, their maps might be verifiable. The maps of Newton and Einstein have been shown to be verifiable; whereas almost all of the map making of Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Hegel, and Whitehead are non-verifiable. </p>,<p>If a map is not directly verifiable then it is just a mental creation of the mapmaker’s own crafting and it describes nothing but the internal world of their own creation.</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkUFPwzAMhe_9FVGRWCutCSAhIdruMIkDl12AE0IoS5wt3ZpUcVqoEP8ddyuIWxx_es9-rrQdmNV1arZF8D6mq0rQ1yqpUAXbxVVmeqei9S7TS4ZLYnP2lTA2yMAaqk2DrGaa7yA-HKEFF3E9PsvdRraQYf569VYSbQ3L_jPr8VFnJJWzALEPbmJmIRVARpg5Uiipwa2mntVnjGNQVKZCKO8cqMiNVLD1_sAdRAHu_eVJoD7wBi8-zbY91teXAwSkJerhht-lkwzNzTsZyGPjNXDrEEJcg_EBsnmvvEy-M-1VP02yZItzIgt6_foVDZLPIs_LSsx5JUk1RaqOEvGUqvLtKZWUaRllsQ9g6nQfY4f3QsQ97ILVXFphrNPF6PtQfMhRzLTr285jJKXbv8v8ANFaj7U" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

What we usually call “consciousness” the fact that I am aware of myself and therefore in a sense can appear to myself, would never suffice to guarantee reality.&nbsp; (19-20)</p>,<p>Still, all sense-endowed creatures have appearance as such in common, first, an appearing world and second, and perhaps more important, the fact that they themselves are appearing and disappearing creatures, that there always was a world before their arrival and there always will be a world after their departure.</p>,<p>To be alive means to live in a world that preceded one’s own arrival and will survive one’s own departure.

Similarly, in Ancient Greek, Protagoras used the Greek word <em>anthrōpos </em>(<em>human being, person</em>), making a general statement about human beings.</p>,<p>What I think the phrase means is that it reveals that we understand the world through the lens of our own perspective. The world is experienced on a non-verbal direct sensory level. However, once we begin to process that non-verbal data we select and transform it into our human symbols systems. Hence we are the measuring tool that forces all things to conform to. We only understand the world through this process of selection and interpretation.</p>]]></description>
