            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/379f43e6-e323-4bfe-8111-6684fbe82337.jpg">,<h2><em>The Vision of Micah….a time without religious strife.</em></h2>,<p>To understand what I am about to tell you may require you to suspend what you believe you already know. What you know will more than likely act as a filter and prevent you from considering something new. Can you suspend belief?</p>,<p>Micah was a prophet during the years 739 through 693 BCE, during the reigns of three kings of Judah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Christians, Muslims, and even Jews, despite the fact that all three recognize that prophets such as Micah are considered valid speakers of the Divine’s truth to humanity, generally overlook one of Micah’s prophecies. Micah’s description of the end of days is similar to Isaiah’s, but with a very significant difference; the difference I believe is why his message is so often ignored.</p>,<p>The vision of Micah that I wish to focus on leaves behind the voice of the genocidal God and the concept of herem that is depicted in the Book of <em>Deuteronomy</em> and the Book of <em>Samuel</em> and instead proclaims a new way to walk with God.</p>,<p>His prophecy is important, and its significance has implications for all religions, though only Judaism, Christianity, and Islam believe that the Hebrew prophets convey a message from the Infinite Divine. I will cite in full the first five verses of chapter four; I will use the Jewish Publication Society’s 1955 translation. I suggest that you compare it with your favorite English translation.</p>,<p><em>1. But in the end of days it shall come to pass, That the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established as the top of the mountains, And it shall be exalted above the hills; And peoples shall flow unto it.</em></p>,<p><em>2. And many nations shall go and say: ‘Come ye, and let us to up to the mountain of the Lord, And to the house of the God of Jacob; And He will teach us of His ways, And we will walk in His paths; For out of Zion shall go forth the law, And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</em></p>,<p><em>3. And He shall judge between many peoples, And shall decide concerning mighty nations afar off; And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, And their spears into pruning-hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, Neither shall they learn war any more.</em></p>,<p><em>4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; And none shall make them afraid; For the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken.</em></p>,<p><em>5. For let all the peoples walk each one is the name of its god, But we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.</em></p>,<p>Micah described a time when nations shall give up war and turn the implements of war into the implements of peaceful agriculture; when people will still toil in their vineyard and in their orchards, but they will no longer be afraid. How and why does this all come about? What is the key element that will change to transform humanity from a war like existence to one of peace?</p>,<p>I believe Micah’s answers this question in his fifth verse.</p>,<p>Throughout the history prior to Micah, the land we in the West call the Middle East has always been a place ravaged by war. Wars were waged by rulers who proclaimed that they were acting in the name of their gods, or more simply, proclaimed that they were gods themselves and thus all should bow down to them. War and religion were intricately tied together, and thus religion was the rationale for all the wars and conquests throughout the Middle East.</p>,<p>To imagine a time of peace would logically mean a time when there would no longer be the proclaimed reason for war—which was that one god needed to dominate all other gods and those who worship other gods. Religious intolerance is the often stated reason for going to war.</p>,<p>I read Micah’s prophecy as an amazingly logical presentation. An amazingly realistic conception of the end of days when the world would be without fear and people would work in their vineyards and orchards. Micah envisions that the world embroiled in war is a world filled with religious intolerance. Therefore a world without war is a world where there exists the complete opposite of the status quo of world ruled by intolerance, a world of universal religious tolerance: ‘<em>For let all the peoples walk each one is the name of its god</em>’.</p>,<p><a href="http://www.academia.edu/9741376/The_Vision_of_Micah" title="">Here is a link to my complete paper.</a></p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkUFPwzAMhe_9FVGRWCutCSAhIdruMIkDl12AE0IoS5wt3ZpUcVqoEP8ddyuIWxx_es9-rrQdmNV1arZF8D6mq0rQ1yqpUAXbxVVmeqei9S7TS4ZLYnP2lTA2yMAaqk2DrGaa7yA-HKEFF3E9PsvdRraQYf569VYSbQ3L_jPr8VFnJJWzALEPbmJmIRVARpg5Uiipwa2mntVnjGNQVKZCKO8cqMiNVLD1_sAdRAHu_eVJoD7wBi8-zbY91teXAwSkJerhht-lkwzNzTsZyGPjNXDrEEJcg_EBsnmvvEy-M-1VP02yZItzIgt6_foVDZLPIs_LSsx5JUk1RaqOEvGUqvLtKZWUaRllsQ9g6nQfY4f3QsQ97ILVXFphrNPF6PtQfMhRzLTr285jJKXbv8v8ANFaj7U" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

it therefore means that it can only be experienced directly via the senses and
this experience is non-symbolic. Symbols are attributed to that experience as
we attempt to understand what happened to us.</p>,<p>Maps are metaphorically symbols, relationships of symbols and systems of symbols.</p>,<p>All maps are finite, static and linear.</p>,<p>The Territory is infinite, dynamic, non-linear, multi-layered and multidimensional.</p>,<p>Therefore any map we make is, as Korzybski noted, cannot be the Territory. We can eat the non-symbolic thing we call an apple, we cannot eat the symbol that is denoted by the word ‘apple’.</p>,<p>Therefore all our maps, our theories and descriptions of the events and processes of reality that I call the Territory are not equivalent. Maps, at best, point toward aspects of the Territory.</p>,<p>Many of the great thinkers do not understand this.</p>,<p>They, these great thinkers, write as if they are directly describing the working of the Territory. However their maps are not the Territory. At best they point toward the Territory and if they are valid and useful they can be verified and help us to find our way.</p>,<p>This error of believing that they are directly describing the Territory is a common one.</p>,<p>Their maps are always incomplete and by their finite nature leave many things out.</p>,<p>Yet the great minds have the hubris to think that their maps are the Territory.</p>,<p>Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Hegel, Whitehead, to name a few of the great mapmakers, all think that what they are describing is true, is accurate, is complete description of the workings of the Territory. </p>,<p>This is not the case.</p>,<p>They are only making their own map and working within a map of their own creation. They are only describing their own creation and not the reality of the working of the Territory.</p>,<p>At best, their maps might be verifiable. The maps of Newton and Einstein have been shown to be verifiable; whereas almost all of the map making of Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Hegel, and Whitehead are non-verifiable. </p>,<p>If a map is not directly verifiable then it is just a mental creation of the mapmaker’s own crafting and it describes nothing but the internal world of their own creation.</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkUFPwzAMhe_9FVGRWCutCSAhIdruMIkDl12AE0IoS5wt3ZpUcVqoEP8ddyuIWxx_es9-rrQdmNV1arZF8D6mq0rQ1yqpUAXbxVVmeqei9S7TS4ZLYnP2lTA2yMAaqk2DrGaa7yA-HKEFF3E9PsvdRraQYf569VYSbQ3L_jPr8VFnJJWzALEPbmJmIRVARpg5Uiipwa2mntVnjGNQVKZCKO8cqMiNVLD1_sAdRAHu_eVJoD7wBi8-zbY91teXAwSkJerhht-lkwzNzTsZyGPjNXDrEEJcg_EBsnmvvEy-M-1VP02yZItzIgt6_foVDZLPIs_LSsx5JUk1RaqOEvGUqvLtKZWUaRllsQ9g6nQfY4f3QsQ97ILVXFphrNPF6PtQfMhRzLTr285jJKXbv8v8ANFaj7U" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our Shared Primary Non-symbolic / Non-verbal world</p>,<p>June 27, 2017</p>,<p>We live in a shared physically real world. A world of objects, that includes ourselves as one of those objects, which we interact with on a non-verbal, non-symbolic immediate level. Actually, the primary level of reality and our interaction with reality is at the level of physical non-verbal, non-symbolic level. I can prove this by a series of examples of interactions that I have with a being who doesn’t know any human cultural concepts that are conveyed via human symbol systems such as the English language.</p>,<p>We share this world with not only other human beings but also a multitude of living and non-living objects. Amongst the category of what we can classify as living are animals, insects, plants, etc. Specifically, I live with my wife and our pet cat that we call Basha.</p>,<p>Basha is a member of that general mixed breed classified as ‘short haired domestic American mackerel tabby cat’. My wife, Cedar, and I adopted Basha from our local animal shelter when she was approximately 5 months old. She is now almost five years old at the time I am writing this.</p>,<p>Now, if I had the experience of being a father of a newborn baby, much of what I am about to describe concerning my interactions with Basha and that six year old infant would be very similar. Both would be able to interact with me almost in the exact same manner. Neither could interact on a verbal level, all of us would be interacting on a non-verbal strictly physical level.</p>,<p>Even a six-month-old infant would not have had the time to acquire language, let alone sophisticated cultural concepts. Such an infant therefore would not understand or even be capable of either 1) imagining a solipsistic world; or 2) the concept of the world as in the Idealistic hypothesis proposed by Bishop Berkeley, i.e., that the world is non-physical
idea that is sustained, and suspended in the mind of God; or 3) know the Hindu concept of Maya, which states that the physical world is an illusion. All of these cultural constructs would have to be taught to that infant for her to have them and believe them. All those ideas, and any others that you can imagine and proposed that would describe the world as not being physically real, would have to be taught to her for her to believe and or consider them. Therefore, while as a six-year-old infant she would simply be blissfully ignorant of those symbolic sophisticated cultural concepts, and simply interact as described below on a strictly physical manner and thus demonstrate the reality of our shared physical world. Therefore demonstrating the fact of the primary and fundamental reality of our physical existence.</p>,<p>Basha is an indoor and outdoor cat. We all live in a one bedroom ‘In-law house’ that is situated behind the main duplex in the front of our shared lot, in the suburbs of Berkeley, California, USA.</p>,<p>In our shared world, we can communicate with each other on a physical non-linguistic level. </p>,<p>She knows that we can ‘hear’ sounds just as she can hear sounds. She knows that we make sounds to communicate with her and she can make sounds to communicate with us.</p>,<p>We call her by that name, she clearly doesn’t know that name in the same way that we do. We are humans and she is a feline, a cat. We don’t share the same biological systems to allow her to create and interact with symbol systems such as the English language not even on a verbal auditory
level. However, she does react to the sound of us calling her name. She
probably recognizes the tone of our voice more than the actual sound of those
specific letters. Again, she is not a human and so she does not have the
capacity of translating certain sounds and recognizing that they are the sounds
of the letters in her name. She only recognizes the pure tonal qualities of the
sound.</p>,<p>She knows the sound of a can being opened. She knows the
sound of her crunchy treats rattling around in its plastic container. Both of
those sounds will usually bring her to us. She ‘knows’ that this means she will
get food. She associates those sounds with the experience of us giving her
food.</p>,<p>She also ‘knows’ the sound of me snapping my fingers and of
my wife whistling. Those are two of the ways we call her in at night. She knows
that when we she hears those sounds and she comes to us she will get her
evening meal. The other sound that we can use to get her to come inside at
night is the sound of her treats rattling around inside the plastic container.
We can shake that container and Basha knows that this sound means she will get
some treats if she comes to us.</p>,<p>Basha has a sense of space and time. This ability to
recognize certain aspects of spacial and temporal relationships would either make
Immanuel Kant proud or completely confuse him. I’m not sure of Kant believed
and/or recognized that creatures other than humans had to ability to work with
some of his ‘A Priori’ constructs, such as time and space, that he described in
his book the <em>Critique
of Pure Reason</em>. Basha clearly has no ability to understand the
words ‘A Prioir’, let alone the concepts as Kant meant them in his book. Then
again, the experience of failing to understand that concepts of space and time
as A Priori concepts that are part of Kant's doctrine of the transcendental ideality
of space and time is something she has in common with a majority of people on
this planet.</p>,<p>Basha knows the difference between ‘indoors’ and ‘outdoors’.
She knows the shape of our small house. She knows where her litter box is
located. She knows where her food dish is located. She knows where her food and
treats are kept. She knows where our beds are located and she knows that we
spend time on those beds and understands that we sleep on those beds. She knows
that she ‘sleeps’ and so does my wife and I.</p>,<p>Although, I am not sure she knows the difference between
‘awake’ and ‘asleep’. Her hearing is so attuned that certain sounds will get
her attention even if she is what I think that she is sleeping at the time. The
sound of a can opening or her treats rattling in the container will almost
immediately bring her out of sleep to come running to where that sound is being
made. Hence, I am not sure how different or how she experiences the difference
between sleeping and being awake. I’m sure it is different than my experience.
I don’t have that ability to react to sounds like Basha can when I am asleep. I
have been told that it seems as if that nothing short of a loud explosion could
wake me from a sound sleep.</p>,<p>She will share that activity of sleep with us, by getting on
the bed, lying next to us, hence demonstrating she knows the concepts ‘near’
and far’, and then close her eyes and sleep with us. </p>,<p>She knows that she can go out the bathroom window, and come
back into the same-shared space through the front door. She knows ‘up’, ‘down’
‘high’ and ‘low’. She knows that she is usually lower than us, that the floor
is beneath her and that she can climb up onto couches, chairs, bookshelves,
tables, beds, and other objects to get ‘up’ and be level with us, interacts
with us and look us in the eye. She knows she can easily get ‘under’/’below’
beds, chairs, couches, tables, and that we have more difficulties doing the
same and that we can’t get underneath them completely. Hence, she knows the
concept of ‘hiding’, ‘escaping’, ‘being hidden’, ‘being unreachable’, etc. when
she wants to avoid interacting with us, or wants to play with us knowing we
can’t as easily get to her when she is ‘lower’/ ‘down’/ ‘under’ certain objects
in relationship to us.</p>,<p>Her sense of time is so attuned that she knows that I go
away most days. Though she clearly does not know where I am going and why. She
knows I come back at a certain time of the day each workday. Her sense of time
is so strong that she will usually, about 80% of the time, come inside and be
in the house waiting for me to arrive from work. She knows that I will come in
and pick her up, hold her in my arms and make sounds at her while I scratch
her. She purrs when I do this and she knows that I react to that purring sound
and will scratch her some more. She also knows how to get me to stop petting
and scratching her so that she can be let back down.</p>,<p>She has such an excellent sense of time that she is able to
recognize the difference between my workdays and the weekends. She somehow has
a sense of my workweek, and the weekend, because during the workdays she will
come into the house waiting for me to arrive from work while she won’t do that
on the weekends. She knows that I come home about the same time every day
during the week and that I will pick her up, pet, and scratch her when I come
home. Whereas on the weekends there is no set time that this occurs and so she
does not show up at that time.</p>,<p>She knows that she will get wet cat food twice a day. Once
during the morning and the other time at night. For a time when my wife and I
would divide the feeding of Basha between us, my wife feeding her at night and
me feeding her in the morning, Basha knew this. She would come to Cedar and try
to communicate to her to get her evening wet food meal and Basha would ignore
me. We ruined that sense routine, and now I feed Basha both in the morning and
at night her wet food.</p>,<p>When she is hungry, which is more often than when we have
agreed to be her two daily feeding times, she will go over to where her food
dish is or where her food and treats are kept and she will make certain sounds
to communicate with us. She will also get up on her hind legs and scratch at
the side of the kitchen cabinet next to her food bowl to get our attention. </p>,<p>She knows that sometime when she makes noise, or scratches
at the kitchen cabinet, or bats at us when we are sitting at the kitchen
chairs, she may be able to convince us to give her some treats. She knows that
it doesn’t always work but that behavior works enough of the time for her to
remember it, and do it, and expect to often enough get fed some treats.</p>,<p>

Hence we are the measuring tool that forces all things to conform to. We only understand the world through this process of selection and interpretation.</p>]]></description>
